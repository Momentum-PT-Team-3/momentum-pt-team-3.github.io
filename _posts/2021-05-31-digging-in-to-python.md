- Note: this is your first assignment from GitHub. When you accept this assignment by clicking the link, a "repository" will be generated on GitHub with your name on the end of it. We will learn more later about working on a team with GitHub. Below is what you need to know right now. For more on GitHub, check out this [talk by Sarah Guthals](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Start-Dev-Change/Start-Dev-Change/Introduction-to-GitHub). 

- To work on the code in VS Code:
0. Copy the URL to your repository.

1. Make sure you are in your homework directory.

2. At the command prompt, type
`git clone <url that you copied>`
This will make a directory with the same name as the repository.

3. `cd` into the new directory.

4. When you have work you want to put in the remote repository:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m"<write a message>"`
- `git push`

This is like "saving" your code to the remote repository. You can do this multiple times.
