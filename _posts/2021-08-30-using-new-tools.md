## 🎥 This Week's Videos
1. Take some time out to continue viewing [Katie's Career Services modules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GLQox2UwiLJwgLAYysLUSrkX5zPVxXt47IpRRqD7eY/edit?usp=sharing). Katie will be coming to class soon to answer questions & discuss the modules.


### 🎯  This Week's Projects
This week will be another code-focused week. *We will be completing this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-django-blog/).*

The tutorial involves a few new tools and concepts, which you will have to research, in addition to reviewing Django app structure and models. The project will look significantly different from our previous Django apps. The instructions of the tutorial should enable you to to execute these correctly, but for background information, you'll need to seek that out. This is intended to mimic the situation in which you arrive on a new work project, and you have to familiarize yourself with the code and the tools it uses.

- GraphQL and graphene-django to build an API. This will be an example of an app that consumes its own API, versus an external API.
- Vue.js for a front end based on re-usable components. This library is similar to React but a little lighter weight for learning.

*Please keep a document in the style of your choice while you execute this tutorial. Record your questions here as well as answers to these questions and how you arrived at them. This will take the place of the video question form.*
