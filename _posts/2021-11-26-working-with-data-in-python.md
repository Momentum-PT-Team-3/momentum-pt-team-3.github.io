## 🔖 Assignments for the Upcoming Week
- We will be working on the [Mystery Word](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZEb8R8Ls) assignment all week. The Suggested Approach section breaks the assignment down into smaller chunks, but you are not obligated to approach the assignment that way.

- Once you have accepted the assignment, run `git clone <url>` and then `cd` into the directory to work on it locally.

* Each class, you will fill out a short entrance ticket to indicate where you are, and you will be grouped with people in a similar place on the assignment. *

## 🦉 Notes

### 🐍 🆕 Python Notebooks: The Prequel 🆕 🐍
- Consolidated summary of concepts described in detail in the Python Notebooks has been added to the class [notes repository](https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/notes/blob/main/python-notebooks-prequel.md).

###  🐍 📒 Python Notebooks 📒 🐍
- Make a directory to hold your Python Notebooks
- Clone the repository [here](https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/python-notebooks) into that directory:
      * ```git clone <url of notebooks> .```
- These notebooks are a written resource for the Python concepts we will learn, like an interactive textbook.
- From inside the directory in the terminal, run `jupyter notebook` to open the notebooks.
