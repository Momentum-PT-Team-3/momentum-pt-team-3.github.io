## 🦉 Notes

### 🐍 🆕 Python Notebooks: The Prequel 🆕 🐍
- Consolidated summary of concepts described in detail in the Python Notebooks has been added to the class [notes repository](https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/notes/blob/main/python-notebooks-prequel.md).

###  🐍 📒 Python Notebooks 📒 🐍
- Make a directory to hold your Python Notebooks
- Clone the repository [here](https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/python-notebooks) into that directory:  
      ```git clone <url of notebooks> .```
- These notebooks are a written resource for the Python concepts we will learn, like an interactive textbook.
- From inside the directory in the terminal, run `jupyter notebook` to open the notebooks.
