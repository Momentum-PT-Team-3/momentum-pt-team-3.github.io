## ðŸ”– Assignment for this week and Next

In pairs, work on completing the [Django Music](https://classroom.github.com/a/ueLCjCk0) assignment, in 
which you will build a web application in the spirit of iTunes or Spotify. Note that the specs are broken
down into bullet points, and its helpful to tackle those one at a time, in order.
