## ðŸ”– Assignment for last week and this week

In pairs, continue completing the [Django Music](https://classroom.github.com/a/ueLCjCk0) assignment, in 
which you will build a web application in the spirit of iTunes or Spotify. Note that the specs are broken
down into bullet points, and its helpful to tackle those one at a time, in order.

### Checklist of Assignment Specs
Your app is complete when a user can:
- [ ] See a list of all albums on the homepage
- [ ] Create a new album
- [ ] See a detail page for one existing album
- [ ] Edit an existing album
- [ ] Delete an existing album
- [ ] See an appealing, understandable layout with some style (css)

ðŸŒ¶ Spicy Options (if above checklist is complete)
- [ ] Add an Artist model and create a foreign key on the Album model to associate the two.
- [ ] Show the Artist and their other albums on the album detail page, with links to those album detail pages.
- [ ] Create an way to mark an album as a favorite. Favorited albums are displayed with a star next to them (how you choose to show this is up to you). A user should be able to click on the star, or a link or button, to mark the album as a favorite.
- [ ] Add an option to sort all albums on the list page by title, year, or artist.
