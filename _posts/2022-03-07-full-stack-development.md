## ðŸ”– Assignment for this week
Choose one (or both) of the following tutorials, based on 
whether you are interested in back end or front end development on the final project. You may not implement everything from the tutorial in your final project, but they touch on the core concepts for modern Django app development

Front End - [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk)
Back End - [Build a Rest API with Django Rest Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlr9BF4JomE)

Note: for your final project, you will be able to either build an API or use an existing API, as we did on this last project. Depends on the interests of your team.
