# Check-in Schedule Expectations
These are guidelines, not rules, so students may not be precisely hitting these deadlines. That is ok. This is meant to give the instructor and students a sense for where students should be at each point.

### How to use your time with Kelly:
- Update on what you have done
- Figure out what to do next
- Address any blockers

## Week 1 - March 21-25
- Clear product description/vision with wireframes
- Architecture decided 
    - Are you building a back end with DRF, using an existing API, or both??
    - What, if any, info are you storing in the database?
    - [API example from class](https://github.com/rlconley/final-project-api-recipeez)
Note: if you are building a back end with DRF, you need a separate repo for that. If you aren’t building an API and don’t want to save user info, you don’t need Django at all
    - Are you using React or Vanilla JS for the front end?
- GitHub Project tasks created with backlog, current sprint, and in-progress queued up
- Complete set up or relevant repositories, API accounts, and dependencies, and CSS frameworks (Tachyons, Bulma, etc.)
- Clear definition of MVP to set up the next week

## Week 2 - March 28 - April 1
- Working on must have features
- Ideally deployed at least initially (Netlify for JS, Heroku for Django)
- May not have production data
- Mockups done (on Figma, Excalidraw)

## Week 3 - April 4 - 8
-  At MVP or very close to it
- May have bugs or things still in progress but we can see the app’s main functionality, i.e. the answer to “What does your app do?”

## Week 4 - April 11- 15
- The core functioning of your app should work
- If you had to ship it today, it works -- without any stretch features

## Week 5 - April 18 - 22
FEATURE FREEZE: after this point, no additional features started
- Deployed fully functional app
- Beginning to shape the narrative of your presentation
- Focus switches to fixing bugs and finishing styling

## Week 6 - April 25 - 29
- Bugs fixed, unfinished features / unfixable issues cut
- Styling should be finished with consistent look and feel
- The app should be shippable

## Presentation Week - May 2 - 6
- Prepare screen capture videos with Loom
- More specs for this will be coming closer to the date.
- Presentation screening, May 6, 2022 noon Eastern
