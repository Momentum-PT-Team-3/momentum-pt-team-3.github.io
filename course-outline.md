# Course Outline

For the entire 24 weeks, we are in session Tues-Fri 4:30 - 6:30pm. The classroom Zoom is always open for students who want to work together. Office hours will be listed weekly by the instructor. 

## Class & Assignments

### Weekly
The class website will be updated for the week by EOD Friday. The site will show videos and exercises for the upcoming week and a suggested minimum pace. You are expected to fill out a video form for each video you watch. Earlier in the class, the exercises will be meant to do in one day. Later in the class, as the exercises become more complex, they may take multiple days. Due dates & times will be included with the assignments. Work is "turned in" when it is pushed to GitHub. 

### Benchmark Assignments
Periodically you will have assignments meant to help you and the instructor assess your progress. You will be given feedback and will be asked to respond to that feedback. Completed benchmark assignments can go in your online portfolio with GitHub Pages. 

## Getting Help

Instructors are also available to meet with you on Zoom during office hours times, individually, in groups, or in the co-working Zoom.

The Slack channels where you can get help from instructors, alumni, and classmates are:
- #code-help (alumni & instructors)
- #pt-team-three (our class) 

You can reach out to us on Slack by using an `@` symbol followed by our name in the team channel (for instance, "@Rebecca Conley, when I run `git push origin main`, I get the following error...").
